the model directory is only to save the model pth, all model specifics can be found in the code. 
The code is split into a functions.py to deal with loading files and all calculations outside of the model.
The model lite has the model specifics and the loss functions, except for the loss function of the keypoints.
This can be found in the train.py file. To explore our code you should start here and relate the functions from outside of the file to the code in this file
